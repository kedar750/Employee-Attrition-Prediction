# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

- This project is based on classification output where we have numerical and categorical variable. To make labelled data, we need to apply data preprocessing technique on data to make data useable later we also have to check data colinearity, outliers and Nan values. accordingly we need to use code for tackling with them.

-- This data predict whether person will exit the company on not? however data doesnt have column to predict the output.create output variable and used validation techniuqe to split data into train and test format.

--Finally I used lazy classifier and check how much accuracy is given by all classifiers and also check on test data how it performs.
